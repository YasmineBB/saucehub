## Design

I wanted a fairly minimalist overall design with a striking image on each page, few colours that complement each other and 

### Colour Scheme

The colours I have chosen for the site maintain a simple, minimalist look with several shades of grey and a green feature colour.

[![Colour-Pallette.png](https://i.postimg.cc/Xv8T5Q2V/Colour-Pallette.png)](https://postimg.cc/GB47wJwN)
I chose green to be the complimentary color as it matches the green colour often associated with chillis and also matches with the green on the landing image. It is softer than red, a colour often associated with chillies and hot sauce but can often be too bold, and goes with the tone of the site. 
The greys tie in wih the darker tone of the background images used in the site and the green complements the green in the hero image on the homepage. The green is used for the icons, borders and when the hover selector is used.


### Typography 

I wanted a bolder font for the logo and headings, and a softer font for the majority of the text on the site; therefore decided on the following from Google Fonts:

* Bebas Neue
* Roboto

 Bebas Neue is a bold font that stands out to the user, so is used in the logo and h1 and h2 elements. Roboto compliments it nicely, and is used for h3 and all other text on the site. These two fonts are used throughout the site to maintain consistency. Sans Serif is used as a fallback font.

 ### Images 

The images used in the site have a darker tone in nature
Landing Page Hero Image
The landing page includes a hero image of a basket of chillies and the colours are stark against the grey background which stands out to the user. Beneath the image is some leading text which, alongside the photo, hopes to show the user that this page will offer what they are looking for and provide them with incentive to stay. This slogan text also links to the Find Your Sauce and Make your sauce pages when hovered over on desktop view, and highlighted in green on mobile view.

The spice level section provides a visually suggestive insight of what is to come on the page, with a list of common chillis used and their spice level. This will help them when going on to look for sauces in their preferred spice level range.
