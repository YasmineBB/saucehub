# Saucehub

Sauehub is a site with the intention of matching users with the perfect hot sauce for their own flavour preferences, as well as providing a hub of recipes to make their own.

The site is targeted to those who use hot sauce and want to find more choice by providing both homemade and shop bought options catered to their palette. The site caters to all with the options to choose on a scale from mild to extra hot.


## Features


### Logo and Navigation Bar


The logo and navigation bar are all fully responsive, featuring on all three pages as well as the form submit page. Using Bebas Neue for the logo and Roboto for the navigation bar from Google Fonts, these two fonts are used consistently throughout the site to maintain consistency. Bebas Neue is a bold font that stands out to users, so is used in the logo and headings and Roboto compliments it nicely, and is used with all other text on the site. 

The navigation bar contains Font Awesome icons to visually represent the pages on the site
* A Home icon for the Home page
* A Mortar and Pestle icon to represent the Recipes page
* A Chilli icon to represent the Find Your Sauce page

The chilli icon is also used again on the homepage and recipes page to represent the sites intentions for example to illustrate the spice level which UX DESIGN

The icons are in green, which is one of three main colours used across the site, as well as grey (light slate gray and dim gray are used) and white. I chose green to be the complimentary color as it matches the green of chillis and also matches with the green on the landing image. It is more softer than red, a colour often associated with Chilli and hot sauce but can often be too bold, and goes with the tone of the site. 

The navigation bar has a hover feature which is fixed on the active page and appears when a user hovers over the other pages. 


### Images 

The images used in the site have a darker tone in nature
Landing Page Hero Image
The landing page includes a hero image of a basket of chillies and the colours are stark against the grey background which stands out to the user. Beneath the image is some leading text which, alongside the photo, hopes to show the user that this page will offer what they are looking for and provide them with incentive to stay. This slogan text also links to the Find Your Sauce page when hovered over.

### Your Spice Level Section

The spice level section provides a visually suggestive insight of what is to come on the page, with a list of common chillis used and their spice level. This will help them when going on to look for sauces in their preferred spice level range. 


### Footer Section

The footer section contains links to the four main social media sites:

* Instagram
* Twitter
* Facebook
* Youtube
  
In tying in with the colour scheme of the site, they are dimgray with a green hover feature. When clicked they open in a new tab. 
This feature encourages the user to stay connected through social media, 


## Find Your Sauce 
This page has a form where users can answer questions to help them find the right sauce based on the answers they provide. There arenâ€™t too many questions to avoid deterring the user.

The intention is to provide the consumer with a short selection of sauces on first use.
